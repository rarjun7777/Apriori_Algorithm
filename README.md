-> Performed Apriori Algorithm on Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv


# STEPS IN APRIORI ALGORITHM

-> Importing the libraries

-> Data Preprocessing

-> Training the Apriori model on the dataset

-> Visualising the results

-> Displaying the first results coming directly from the output of the apriori function

-> Putting the results well organised into a Pandas DataFrame

-> Displaying the results non sorted

-> Displaying the results sorted by descending lifts
